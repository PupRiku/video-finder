3.  Run the installer and launch the application from the desktop shortcut or Start Menu.

## For Developers

To run this project in a development environment, you will need two terminals.

### 1. Backend Setup & Run

1.  Navigate to the `/backend` folder.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Package the backend into an executable by running: `pyinstaller --onefile app.py`.
    - This creates the `app.exe` file in `/backend/dist/` that the Electron app needs.

### 2. Frontend Setup & Run

1.  Navigate to the `/frontend` folder in a new terminal.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3.  Run the development server and Electron app concurrently:
    ```sh
    npm run electron:dev
    ```
