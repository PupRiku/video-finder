# AI Video Frame Finder

An AI-powered desktop application to find the source of a video clip by searching a website's thumbnails with a screenshot.

## About The Project

This application allows a user to take a screenshot from a video clip and find its original source on a supported website. It works by scraping the thumbnail images from the site's video pages and using a powerful AI model (CLIP) to find the closest visual match to the user's uploaded image.

This project is a full-stack desktop application built with a React/Next.js frontend and a Python/Flask backend, all wrapped in an Electron sh

## For Developers

To run this project in a development environment, you will need two terminals.

### 1. Backend Setup & Run

1.  Navigate to the `/backend` folder.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Package the backend into an executable by running: `pyinstaller --onefile app.py`.
    - This creates the `app.exe` file in `/backend/dist/` that the Electron app needs.

### 2. Frontend Setup & Run

1.  Navigate to the `/frontend` folder in a new terminal.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3.  Run the development server and Electron app concurrently:
    ```sh
    npm run electron:dev
    ```
